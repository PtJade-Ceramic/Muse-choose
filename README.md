## Introduction

Musicians from beginners to experts create and adapt music with the assistance of computers. Beginners may struggle to identify suitable software and understand concepts such as notation, engraving, playback, and music sequencing.

Widely praised and shared among users, that resource was revised by the group owner into a PDF named "Recommendation for Numbered Music Notation Software" and added to the Group Files on 2025-08-04.

## Principles for drafting of the guidance

To ensure that the guidance is visually accessible, the developers shall:

1. Present all links as plain text rather than attached to other text with the Markdown syntax `[text](url)`.
2. Accompany each link with a corresponding QR code.
3. Limit each paragraph to at most one link to avoid confusion with the relationship of the link with its corresponding QR code.
